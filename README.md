# daisyland

*daisyland* is my second - and now complete iteration of my portfolio! Programmed entirely with vanilla languages (css, html, javascriopt), this project served as my sandbox for developing my webdev skills and experiementing with UI and WebDev layouts! Everythign in this site has been designed and developed by me- incluiding assetwork, animations, and overall aesthetic. Designed to look like another sketchbook page- daisyland is the home of my creative process, and document my creative journey!
