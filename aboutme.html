                    <!-- Hello! I'm Daisy. It's nice to meet you! I’m an emerging <b>product designer</b> and self-declared
                    <b>creative technologist</b>, <b>software developer</b>,<b>designer</b>, and chronic <b>doodler</b>.
                    <br> -->
                        I always a very artsy creative kid. I did local art contests, designed things for my local library, and doodled all the time.
                        I surprised everyone (including myself). with my undergrad pathway, where out of my curiosity for tech I studied Software Engineering.
                        <br><img src="placeholder.png">
                        Though initially super excited to be learning something I'd alwasts been interested in, I was discouraged by the seeming lack of creativity and art. <br>
                        Despite having sworn to dedicate myself wholy to my new venture- I found myself gravitating towards creative roles and involvements anyway.Oops. 
                        <br>
                        While in school worked I in a fabriaction and design lab, joined a mariachi band, started a couple student orgs and served club positons as a graphic designer,
                        and eventually found myself working as a Student Researcher for the UIdeas Lab on projects focused on developing tools for children with ADHD and Hyperactivity. 
                        <br>
                        I used to feel very torn between my curiosity for tech, and my love for creativity and art.With the programming and devleopingpathway becoming more and more 
                        competitve every year - I had started to feel like I was out of my depth, i was a very fish-out-of-water realizaiton.

                        UX has been one of the most delightful pathways I've decided to explore! Since discovering UX, I've rekindled my love for 
                        developing, desing,and doodling, and embraced my inital curiosity for tech and creative passion in designing and developing for fun! 
                        <br>
                        When im not working I'll be 

                        When I'm not working you can find me reading manga, drawing, catch me trying to be rockstar level good at guitaur ( I cant play bar chord, but I have hope), playing at city planner / farmer/ licensed contrator/ demolition expert in my minecraft world.
