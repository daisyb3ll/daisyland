            <p><em>Zac Can’t Have Peanuts!</em> is an original research project created through Chapman University’s SCI-200 Grand Challenges
            Initiative. The project explores how children’s media can raise awareness of allergies, illness, and disability while
            promoting empathy and inclusivity. Our team designed an interactive storybook to help young audiences understand and
            engage with allergy experiences through play and narrative.</p>

    <!-- Problem & Research -->
    <section>
        <h2>problem & research focus</h2>
        <!-- <p><strong></strong> How might children’s media reduce stigma and build empathy around food allergies? -->
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary problem we identified was the lack of accurate and empowering representation of chronic illness in
            children’s media. This gap often leads to stigma and misunderstanding among peers. Our research question was: "How might
            children’s media reduce stigma and build empathy around food allergies?"
            <br>
            We grounded our approach in findings from a literature review on several key topics:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gamified Learning: We found that research consistently shows that gamified, story-based learning improves knowledge and
            recall in children. This insight led us to integrate interactive elements and a game-like format into the narrative.</li>

            <li>
            Narrative as an Educational Tool: Studies on children’s media highlight the power of narrative and storytelling to
            communicate complex topics. By building a relatable story around a character named Zac, we could make the allergy
            experience understandable and relatable, promoting empathy without resorting to fear-based messaging.</li>

            <li>
            The Specificity of Peanut Allergies: We chose to focus on peanut allergies because they are a common and serious health
            concern, making effective education crucial for safety and inclusion.</li>
            <!-- <li>Gaps in accurate, empowering representation of chronic illness in kids’ media.</li>
            <li>Research suggests gamified, story-based learning improves knowledge and recall.</li> -->
        </ul>
        These research findings directly informed our core design goals: to create a product that was educational, empathetic,
        and engaging.

        <!-- wireframing-->
        <section>
            <h2>wireframing</h2>
            <!-- <p><strong></strong> How might children’s media reduce stigma and build empathy around food allergies? -->
            <p>
                Our design process began by translating our research findings into a clear, actionable plan. We worked to combine
                narrative design with accessible UI/UX principles.
                Storyboarding: We storyboarded Zac’s journey through everyday scenarios where food allergies are a factor, such as a
                birthday party or snack time at school. This process helped us map the narrative flow and ensure that each scene had a
                clear learning objective, guiding children on how to safely interact with a peer who has an allergy.
                UI/UX and Wireframes: We created accessible layouts with large tap targets and high-contrast typography in Figma and
                Photoshop. The wireframes focused on a simple, intuitive user flow that allowed children to easily navigate the story
                and interact with different elements without confusion.
