                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The SPARK! Emotion Garden is a mobile and Apple Watch app designed to help children with hyperactivity and attention
                    deficit disorders build independence and emotional regulation through a gamified learning environment.</p>
                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>
                    Children with ADHD often struggle to stay motivated and engaged with traditional tracking methods, making
                    it difficult to consistently complete tasks and build habits.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Our Solution</h4> 
                    <p>We transformed these routines into a playful experience. Logging emotions and completing real-life tasks
                    (like tying shoes) earns in-game rewards, providing tangible validation and encouraging consistency.
                    
                    Primary users: Children with hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders.
                    Secondary audience: Parents and caregivers, who use the app to track progress.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    My design process was heavily influenced by the research findings from the Cool Craig study (Cibrian, 2024), which
                    highlighted the importance of supporting independence through self-sufficiency, autonomy, and fun. We focused on
                    creating a design identity that felt both playful and empowering while mainting and adapting design guidelines for neurodivergent children to 
                    aligning cognitive load and sensory research with user engagement needs.

                Information Architecture and Interactions
                A key challenge was designing a seamless experience between the mobile app and the Apple Watch interface. Wearable
                technology, especially for a younger audience, requires a simplified and intuitive information architecture. My goal was
                to ensure the interactions were quick, clear, and low-friction, minimizing cognitive load for the user.
                For example, the smartwatch interface needed to be an immediate point of contact for emotion logging, using quick taps
                to select a mood. These selections then translated into a plant that the user could tend to in the mobile app's garden.
                This direct connection created a sense of cause and effect, reinforcing the user's agency.

            My initial wireframes focused on the core flow of the app—from logging an emotion on the watch to seeing it appear as a
            new plant in the garden. I explored different layouts for the garden itself, considering how to make it feel dynamic and
            rewarding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prototypes: I developed interactive prototypes to test the user flow, particularly the animation of a new plant
                "growing" in the garden after an emotion was logged. I also prototyped the reward system, showing how a completed
                real-life task would grant the user a reward in the game. These prototypes helped us identify and refine key interaction
                points.

            My main contribution was leading the design of the interaction between the smartwatch and the mobile app, as well as
            proposing the in-game mechanics that would drive engagement and reflection
            I collaborated with a fellow designer to develop a cohesive design system. We chose a bright, cheerful color palette and
            a friendly, rounded font to create a welcoming and non-intimidating user interface. The designs were intentionally
            simple and accessible to avoid overwhelming children with sensory sensitivities. Key design decisions were influenced by
            the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Gamified UI: The central element of our design was the Emotion Garden. Every emotion a child logs becomes a plant they
                can tend to, such as watering it or simply observing its "tranquility." This transforms an abstract concept—tracking
                emotions—into a concrete, rewarding activity.</li>
                <li>In-Game Rewards: We designed a reward system where the completion of real-life tasks, like tying shoes or tidying a
                room, would be rewarded with in-game currency or items. This created a positive feedback loop, motivating children to
                work on their habits.</li>
            </ul>

                <ul>
                <li>Emotion Garden: The core of the app, where users can see a visual representation of their emotions as a vibrant, growing
                    garden.</li>
                <li>Gamified Reflection: Users can "observe" their plants to see which emotion they felt and when, encouraging mindful
                reflection on their emotional state.</li>
                <li>Garden Maintenance Features: Users are prompted to engage with their garden by watering plants and caring for them,
                reinforcing a sense of responsibility and connection to their emotions.</li>
                </ul>
            Leadership and Collaboration
            Beyond the UI design, I also worked to mentor peers in prototyping workflows and onboarded teams to Figma and FigJam.
            This helped to strengthen our collaborative process and foster a more robust research culture within the UIdeas Lab.

                <ul>
                To continue improving the SPARK! Emotion Garden, our next steps would be to:
                <li>Conduct usability testing with our target user group to gather feedback on the in-game mechanics and overall user
                experience.</li>
                <li>Further iterate on the design based on user feedback, focusing on refining the reward system and enhancing the visual
                feedback loops.</li>
                <li>Explore additional gamified elements to support other habits, such as a "task-log" where children can track their
                progress on different goals.</li>
                </ul>
