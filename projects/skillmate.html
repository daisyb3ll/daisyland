            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Skillmate is a UX case study exploring how we can support students and early-career professionals through a more
                empathetic job search experience. This project was completed as a capstone for a software design course and
                explores the emotional challenges of rejection, burnout, and misaligned job filters.</p>
        </section>
        
        <h4>exigence</h4>
        <p>
        In the reality of the job market today, applying for positions and getting hired has turned into a job in itself. More
        and more applications demand hours of work, personalization, and effort. The process has become frustrating and
        anxiety-inducing with the demands of extensive customization, personalization, and requirements.
        <br><br>
        On the flip side, employers face similar challenges in identifying suitable, competent, and promising candidates from
        such a large applicant pool.<br><br>
        
        This mentally exhausting, time consuming, and morale draining process indicates a larger
        issue, in the inefficiency and faults in the role-to-recuiter-to-applicant relationship.

            <p>Skillmate is a supportive and streamlined platform that reimagines the job search experience for students and

                During the ideation phase, we transformed our research insights into <em> actionable design direction</em>.<br>With a focus on
                highlighting student perspectives, we aimed to produce features that reduce overstimulation and feelings of being
                overwhelmed, provide clear and minimalistic pathways for user experiences, and promote self-led and
                community-supported empowerment.</p>

        <p>Our visual identity centered around warmth, clarity, and mutual support. The heart iconography emphasized connection
        and compassion, while the hand-holding symbol stood for professionalism and authenticity. We selected a bold serif
        typeface (Merriweather) to convey structure, paired with a color scheme of complementary orange and blue tones —
        chosen to evoke both confidence and calm.

            <h4>designers commmentary  & project takeaways</h4>
            <p>
            Getting to work on this project was a very rewarding experience, as it was one of the first times I'd ever been trusted
            with project branding, user research, and ux/ui development. While we were only able to begin the iOS prototype before
            the end of the project milestone timeline, the user research and branding created a strong foundation for future
            developments.
            
            During the project, one of my main challenges and responsibilities lay in developing the iOS prototype UI- however due
            to time constraints we prioritized the early phases of the design process to ensure we had a meaningful solution, and a
            clear direction for future iterations.
            </p>

            <h4>what's next</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>complete additonal workflows in Figrma for product use ( recruiter interface, social interaction)</li>
                <li>Build and test a functional iOS prototype</li>
                <li>Conduct remote usability testing with 5–8 students</li>
                <li> do it again! </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> final takeaways</h4>
            <h2>1. User Experience Research can be quantitative.</h2>
            <p>For our research methods, we conducted several testimonio-style interviews and created affinity diagrams to identify
            common themes across users’ experiences with job and career hunting.<br> We chose this qualitative approach because it
            allowed us to center lived experiences and foster more authentic dialogue — something we felt more
            structured surveys or scripted interviews might lack or discourage.<br></br>
            
            While the testimonios gave nuanced insights, incorporating a complementary quantitative method
            such as a short user survey — could have helped us validate trends and reach a wider range of perspectives. Due to
            time constraints, we opted to focus on qualitative depth, but we recognize that combining both methods would have
            provided a more robust foundation for our design decisions. </p>

            <h2>2. Surprise! Project- directed learning.</h2>
            <p> The programming and development portion of this project was definitely a tossed-in-the-deep-end moment for me as before
            this I had zero experience with swift, XCode, and experimenting with motion design and animations. At first I remember
            feeling like I was way over my head, but diving into Swift navigating Xcode taught me a lot through hands-on trial and
            error. I leaned into tutorials, documentation, and community resources to learn as I built. I was definitely pushed past
            my comfort zone, but the experience was very rewarding. </p>
            
            <h2>3. The Power of Branding. It's more than just looks y'know!</h2>
                <p>Through creating this project, I learned just how important branding really is— not just in terms of visuals and making something <em>not ugly</em> but in
                shaping how users feel about a product. Building the brand from scratch taught me that tone, color, and even fonts - all contribute to trust, clarity, and emotional connection. It’s not just about making something pretty; it’s
                about creating a cohesive identity that users can relate to and remember.
