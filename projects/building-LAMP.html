                    LAMP is my senior capstone project! I’m working on this with my best friend, <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/bizsarahyoon/"> Sarah Yoon'25</a> and our fellow girl-who-codes
                    and day 1 - <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-sullivan-4bb233219/">Rory Sullivan'25 </a>.

                    Listen : Album Museum & Portiolio, aka /LAMP, as abbreviated by out JIRA board– is a social media platform made for 
                    music critics, enjoyers, explorers, and haters! Oringinally brainstormed as a music diary and catalog-
                    LAMP has become our re-design and exploration of what it means to be a Listener.

            <h4>designers commmentary  & project takeaways</h4>
            <p>
            Getting to work on this project was a very rewarding experience, as it was one of the first times I'd ever been trusted
            with project branding, user research, and ux/ui development. While we were only able to begin the iOS prototype before
            the end of the project milestone timeline, the user research and branding created a strong foundation for future
            developments.
            
            During the project, one of my main challenges and responsibilities lay in developing the iOS prototype UI- however due
            to time constraints we prioritized the early phases of the design process to ensure we had a meaningful solution, and a
            clear direction for future iterations.
            </p>

            <h4>what's next</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>complete additonal workflows in Figrma for product use ( recruiter interface, social interaction)</li>
                <li>Build and test a functional iOS prototype</li>
                <li>Conduct remote usability testing with 5–8 students</li>
                <li> do it again! </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> final takeaways</h4>
            <h2>1. User Experience Research can be quantitative.</h2>
            <p>For our research methods, we conducted several testimonio-style interviews and created affinity diagrams to identify
            common themes across users’ experiences with job and career hunting.<br> We chose this qualitative approach because it
            allowed us to center lived experiences and foster more authentic dialogue — something we felt more
            structured surveys or scripted interviews might lack or discourage.<br></br>
            
            While the testimonios gave nuanced insights, incorporating a complementary quantitative method
            such as a short user survey — could have helped us validate trends and reach a wider range of perspectives. Due to
            time constraints, we opted to focus on qualitative depth, but we recognize that combining both methods would have
            provided a more robust foundation for our design decisions. </p>

            <h2>2. Surprise! Project- directed learning.</h2>
            <p> The programming and development portion of this project was definitely a tossed-in-the-deep-end moment for me as before
            this I had zero experience with swift, XCode, and experimenting with motion design and animations. At first I remember
            feeling like I was way over my head, but diving into Swift navigating Xcode taught me a lot through hands-on trial and
            error. I leaned into tutorials, documentation, and community resources to learn as I built. I was definitely pushed past
            my comfort zone, but the experience was very rewarding. </p>
            
            <h2>3. The Power of Branding. It's more than just looks y'know!</h2>
                <p>Through creating this project, I learned just how important branding really is— not just in terms of visuals and making something <em>not ugly</em> but in
                shaping how users feel about a product. Building the brand from scratch taught me that tone, color, and even fonts - all contribute to trust, clarity, and emotional connection. It’s not just about making something pretty; it’s
                about creating a cohesive identity that users can relate to and remember.
