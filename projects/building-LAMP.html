            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Listen: Album and Music Portfolio (LAMP), is our Software Engineering Capstone project in which we will be developing LAMP, a
            social media platform for album reviewing.</p>
        <p>
        <br><br>
            <quote> <em>
                Listening to albums is a lost art. Streaming services like Spotify and Apple music have shifted the listening culture
                and experience from enjoying albums front to back, to favoring individual tracks and curated playlists. This shift has
                made it increasingly more difficult to experience albums in their intended sequence – from start to finish. The lack of
                a unified platform for managing and reviewing music diminishes the enjoyment and exploration of someone’s music
                collection. Additionally, many music enthusiasts struggle to find new albums that align with their tastes and engage in
                meaningful discussion about the music they love. Existing music review platforms often lack a personalized
                recommendation system, a strong social component, and an engaging user interface that fosters interaction.
                <br><br>
                Our project aims to solve this problem by creating a socially driven music discovery platform where users can rate,
                review, and discuss albums while also receiving personalized recommendations based on their tastes. The platform will
                incorporate elements of social media (user profiles, comments, likes, and a trending page) while also offering album
                ratings, music curation, and exploration features.

        chosen to evoke both confidence and calm.

            <h4>designers commmentary  & project takeaways</h4>
            <p>
            Getting to work on this project was a very rewarding experience, as it was one of the first times I'd ever been trusted
            with project branding, user research, and ux/ui development. While we were only able to begin the iOS prototype before
            the end of the project milestone timeline, the user research and branding created a strong foundation for future
            developments.
            
            During the project, one of my main challenges and responsibilities lay in developing the iOS prototype UI- however due
            to time constraints we prioritized the early phases of the design process to ensure we had a meaningful solution, and a
            clear direction for future iterations.
            </p>

            <h4>what's next</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>complete additonal workflows in Figrma for product use ( recruiter interface, social interaction)</li>
                <li>Build and test a functional iOS prototype</li>
                <li>Conduct remote usability testing with 5–8 students</li>
                <li> do it again! </li>
            </ul>

            <h4> final takeaways</h4>
            <h2>1. User Experience Research can be quantitative.</h2>
            <p>For our research methods, we conducted several testimonio-style interviews and created affinity diagrams to identify
            common themes across users’ experiences with job and career hunting.<br> We chose this qualitative approach because it
            allowed us to center lived experiences and foster more authentic dialogue — something we felt more
            structured surveys or scripted interviews might lack or discourage.<br></br>
            
            While the testimonios gave nuanced insights, incorporating a complementary quantitative method
            such as a short user survey — could have helped us validate trends and reach a wider range of perspectives. Due to
            time constraints, we opted to focus on qualitative depth, but we recognize that combining both methods would have
            provided a more robust foundation for our design decisions. </p>

            <h2>2. Surprise! Project- directed learning.</h2>
            <p> The programming and development portion of this project was definitely a tossed-in-the-deep-end moment for me as before
            this I had zero experience with swift, XCode, and experimenting with motion design and animations. At first I remember
            feeling like I was way over my head, but diving into Swift navigating Xcode taught me a lot through hands-on trial and
            error. I leaned into tutorials, documentation, and community resources to learn as I built. I was definitely pushed past
            my comfort zone, but the experience was very rewarding. </p>
            
            <h2>3. The Power of Branding. It's more than just looks y'know!</h2>
                <p>Through creating this project, I learned just how important branding really is— not just in terms of visuals and making something <em>not ugly</em> but in
                shaping how users feel about a product. Building the brand from scratch taught me that tone, color, and even fonts - all contribute to trust, clarity, and emotional connection. It’s not just about making something pretty; it’s
                about creating a cohesive identity that users can relate to and remember.
