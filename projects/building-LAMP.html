            <h2>intro</h2>
                <p>
                    LAMP is my senior capstone project, created with Sarah Yoon ‚Äô25 and Rory Sullivan ‚Äô25. Originally brainstormed as a
                    music diary and catalog, it grew into a social platform for music appreciation and connection.
                    
                    LAMP allows listeners to catalog their music journey, discover new sounds, and connect with others through shared
                    exploration of what it means to be a Listener.

        <h5>Problem & Competitive Analysis</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and SoundCloud provide access to music, but they center on streaming
            and
            playlists. Platforms like Letterboxd and RateYourMusic show the value of cataloging, reviewing, and community
            engagement.
            <br>
            Our Problem Statement:
            How might we create a platform for listeners ‚Äî not influencers ‚Äî that allows them to share, reflect, and connect
            authentically through music?
            <br>
            Insights from competitive analysis:
        <ul>
            <li>Spotify / Last.fm ‚Üí discovery & algorithmic feeds work, but lack depth in community critique.</li>
            <li>Letterboxd / Goodreads ‚Üí strong review culture & diary-like cataloging could inspire music-specific
                features.</li>
            <li>Discord / niche forums ‚Üí authentic communities thrive when there‚Äôs less hierarchy and more anonymity.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="overview">
        <h5>what does it mean to be a<em> Listener</em>?</h5>
        <hr>
        <h3>audiophiles, critics,fans & enjoyers</h3>
        <p> One of our proposed ideas for LAMP was the use of user types, kind of like personality quizzes and personality
            types, we liked the idea of different kinds of music enjoyers and debated what each kind of person would want
            from a
            social platform- and then saw potential in the categorization. After a lot of self reflection, and
            brainstorming,
            and research we landed on four distinct user types.</p>
    
        <p>We explored different user types to frame how people interact with music:
        <ul>
            <li>üéß Audiophile ‚Äî niche, experimental tastes; seeks artistry.</li>
            <li>üåä Explorer ‚Äî open to genres, driven by discovery.</li>
            <li>üìù Critic ‚Äî knowledgeable; values deep analysis and review.</li>
            <li>üíø Fan ‚Äî personal connection, memory-based engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        These user types shaped our interaction design and informed our algorithms (e.g., Critics get industry newcomers,
        Explorers get emerging genres).
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="overview">
        <h5>Design Opportunities</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>Based on our research, we saw opportunities to design features for:
        <ol>
            <li>Music Diary / Annotation ‚Üí space to document personal notes, critiques, or reflections.</li>
            <li>User Type-Driven Feeds ‚Üí tailoring exploration to Audiophiles, Critics, Fans, Explorers.</li>
            <li>Anonymous Social Interaction ‚Üí authentic sharing without influencer hierarchies.</li>
            <li>Album Interaction Models ‚Üí exploring metaphors like picking CDs, vinyls, or cassettes.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="overview">
        <h5> users & interactions </h5>

            </video>
        </div>
        <p>
            With our Listeners in mind, we set out to model interaction around them from the start, allowing them to decide
            their user journeys from the start.
        <ol>
            <li>picking cd albmums (explorer)</li>
            <li>picking from a list of vinyls (critic)</li>
            <li>picking things from the cd (listener)</li>
            <li>picking from cassettes (fan)</li>

            </div>
        </section>
        In addition to this, we also designed the flows for:
        <ul>
            <li>Landing Page ‚Üí intro to the platform.</li>
            <li>Annotation Mode ‚Üí write notes, reflect, and share.</li>
            <li>User Interaction Models ‚Üí explore albums via different metaphors.</li>
        </ul>
        We also built demo prototypes to explore how annotation and diary functions could feel in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on these user types and selections, user algorithms, explore pages, and content would be altered, for
            example an <strong>Audiophile</strong> is someone who knows what they like, theyre into the niche and the
            abstract.
            The feed includes more artsy sounds- more Cordex, less Katy Perry.
            <br>
            An <strong>Explorer</strong> is someone that likes music- but wants to get out there and discover more genres-
            theyre jumping into the deep end of the pool.
            <br>
            A Critic is someone well versed in the medium- they've heard it all and they know how to appreciate it! Critic's
            feeds feature industry newcomers,old names-
            new names- and new sounds alike, the critic only seeks to enjoy and leave their piece behind.

            We liked the idea of a music diary- kind of like today's junk journals but more music specific and more
            techy. We wanted to make it so people could have a space to annotate, document, and share their love, hate,
            admiration, connection, and critiques with each other - or privately.

            We had ideas for social interacton! We want people to explore, to share, and to connect- but at the same
            time we want people to be authentic to themselves, their tastes, and their experiences!
            With /LAMP we never want there to be influencers or stars - just listeners!
            With that in mind our user interaciton and social system is a bit different to mosts in that everyone- and
            we mean <em>everyone</em> is anonymous. We're all strangers after all!

            <p>If given more time, I would have loved to build out database functionality for storing user profiles and diary entries, as well as commentds under user reviews.
                I would like to create functional prototypes for reviews and community features, because although the project was for school, seeing as the grade was only for software functionality and not 
                end to end completion, I was never able to finish the project with my team to ever devlop it to launch.
